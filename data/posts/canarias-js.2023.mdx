# JSDay Canarias 2023

## Welcome to JSDay Canarias 2023

This year there was an impressive level among both speakers and visitors. I networked with people from different positions than mine, but what I loved most about this edition is being able to meet up with old friends again and celebrate with them this incredible event we have in Tenerife.

In this edition of JSDay Canarias I have attended these talks that I found very enriching both technologically and personally:

1. [Making Felix Felicis](#kent)
2. [Storybook, the best friend we all need](#anna)
3. [Rerenders vs surgical updates, what's the fuss about?](#braulio)
4. [Testing and simple design with TypeScript](#carlos)

### Making Felix Felicis<a name="kent"></a>

In this talk, Kent Dodds shared the ingredients he has used to create his own luck, and hopes he can help us create our own.

### Storybook, the best friend we all need<a name="kent"></a>

As frontend developers, we always have problems to manage, reuse and maintain UI components. Anna's proposal for this talk was to show Frontenders the magic and potential of the Storybook library. Anna presented the different approaches we can take when using storybook, as well as the many benefits it can have for our daily work.

### Rerenders vs surgical updates, what's the fuss about?<a name="braulio"></a>

Why are we so obsessed with re-rendering? What are the benefits of surgical updates? In this talk Braulio Diez and Daniel Sanchez compared both approaches and why surgical updates seem to be the future of web development.

### Testing and simple design with TypeScript<a name="carlos"></a>

In this talk Carlos BlÃ© told us about some principles and concrete techniques to prevent the code from degenerating and slowing down the implementation of functionalities.

But beyond the talks, I want to thank the organization for creating a warm and welcoming environment. The opportunity to interact with other attendees, share ideas and make meaningful connections was invaluable. The passion and dedication of everyone involved in the organization was evident in every interaction.

JSDay Canarias was not only an educational event, but also a catalyst for personal and professional growth. I felt inspired and motivated by the community of developers gathered there, and I am sure that the connections and knowledge gained will accompany me in my career.

In conclusion, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the JSDay Canarias organization for providing us with a truly memorable event. For making this exceptional event possible, your dedication, effort and passion were reflected in every aspect of the event, and I am excited to see what future editions have in store. JSDay Canarias has left a lasting impression on me, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of this unforgettable experience.
