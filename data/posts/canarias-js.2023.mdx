## Welcome to JSDay Canarias 2023<a name="welcome"></a>

This year there was an impressive level among both speakers and visitors. I networked with people from different positions than mine, but what I loved most about this edition is being able to meet up with old friends again and celebrate with them this incredible event we have in Tenerife.

Not forgetting that this year we could also enjoy the presence of Kent C. Dodds. For those who don't know who Kent C. Dodds is, he is a well-known software engineer, educator, and speaker in the JavaScript and React communities. He is known for his contributions to open source projects and his efforts to teach and empower developers through his online courses, workshops, and conference talks. has created popular open source projects like React Testing Library and Downshift and has made significant contributions to various other projects in the JavaScript ecosystem. He is a strong advocate for testing, accessibility, and best practices in software development.

Being able to engage in a conversation with him has been a dream come true, as his knowledge and hands-on approach has allowed me to delve deeper into key React concepts and discover the importance of testing in developing robust and reliable applications. Thanks to his guidance and valuable resources, I have gained a solid foundation and am excited to continue learning and applying his teachings. Kent C. Dodds is a true reference in the development community and his passion for sharing knowledge has left a lasting impression on me.

### Storybook, the best friend we all need<a name="kent"></a>

As frontend developers, we always have problems to manage, reuse and maintain UI components. Anna's proposal for this talk was to show Frontenders the magic and potential of the Storybook library. Anna presented the different approaches we can take when using storybook, as well as the many benefits it can have for our daily work.

### Rerenders vs surgical updates, what's the fuss about?<a name="braulio"></a>

Why are we so obsessed with re-rendering? What are the benefits of surgical updates? In this talk Braulio Diez and Daniel Sanchez compared both approaches and why surgical updates seem to be the future of web development.

But beyond the talks, I want to thank the organization for creating a warm and welcoming environment. The opportunity to interact with other attendees, share ideas and make meaningful connections was invaluable. The passion and dedication of everyone involved in the organization was evident in every interaction.

JSDay Canarias was not only an educational event, but also a catalyst for personal and professional growth. I felt inspired and motivated by the community of developers gathered there, and I am sure that the connections and knowledge gained will accompany me in my career.

In conclusion, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the JSDay Canarias organization for providing us with a truly memorable event. For making this exceptional event possible, your dedication, effort and passion were reflected in every aspect of the event, and I am excited to see what future editions have in store. JSDay Canarias has left a lasting impression on me, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of this unforgettable experience.
