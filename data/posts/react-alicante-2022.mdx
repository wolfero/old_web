I want to thank my travel partners who told me about this event and I was able to attend with them and learn many new things.

## What is React Alicante?

-   10 Workshops, do you want to boost your skills? This year we have 8 workshops covering different topics and levels.
-   600 In-Person + Remote, be one of them and enjoy a few days of learning, networking, sunbathing and fun.

## My experience.

It was the first time I had traveled to such a high level event and it was the second event I had attended. When we arrived in Alicante, we were very hungry and went out to eat. We found a place where the food was wonderful.

On the first day of the event I was nervous, as all the talks were going to be in English and I doubted that I would understand everything they said.

But those nerves vanished when I realized that my English is much better than I thought and I could fully understand the speakers in the talks. The next step was to lose the fear of talking to people in English. So I set out during the breaks to walk around the different stands. I was able to meet many interesting companies and people thanks to this event.

I was able to appreciate the leading technologies that are used with React and that are already on my roadmap to take a look at them later, such as State Machines or GraphQL.

In the evening I was able to enjoy a wonderful sunset which I did not hesitate to take a picture.

The last day, after the talks we had dinner at a wonderful place, Marmarela Mediterranean Cocktail Club. Both the atmosphere and the music were very pleasant. If I come back to Alicante one day, I will surely visit it again to have a good time.

Finally, we have been given many gifts already from the event itself, as the companies themselves in their booths, not to mention the many stickers that I have been offered and now proudly decorate my laptop.

## In conclusion.

If you can afford the trip, the stay and the event, do not hesitate to attend the event. It is a unique and wonderful experience that I recommend to all programming enthusiasts. If there is a React Alicante 2023, I will surely go with great desire.
