## What is snapshot testing?

Snapshot testing is a type of “output comparison” or “golden master” testing. These tests prevent regressions by comparing the current characteristics of an application or component with stored “good” values for those characteristics.

## How Snapshot Testing Works

As the name suggests, Snapshot testing records take a snap of the system. In Jest, this would be a render tree. Then it compares the recorded snapshot in future executions.

## Benefits of Snapshot testing

-   It introduces a clear pattern for testing the component render trees.
-   Easier to view code changes.
-   Easier to update when the component changes.
-   Allows conditional rendering tests.
-   Allows checking how components behave once you pass various combinations of props to them

## Difference with functional/unit test

The main difference between snapshot testing and functional/unit tests is, snapshot tests never assert the correct behavior of the application functionality but does an output comparison instead.

## My conclusion

Snapshot tests are easy to create and they are a great way to check that your application’s behavior isn’t changing unexpectedly during development. I’ve tested snapshot tests , but I still prefer functional/unit tests, because they bring me more security.
